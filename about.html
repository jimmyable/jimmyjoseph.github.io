<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Growing up different places such as India, Oman and Scotland, I have an inclination to travel and learn about different cultures and ideologies.</p>

<p>From a young age I used to break open my toys, I distinctly remember breaking open a battery-powered car and being mesmerised at how the motor rotated when connected to the battery. Even though I didn't put the toy back together, I ended up making a new toy windmill using the parts. I was 7 when my father got me my first computer. With Intel Pentium D and Windows XP it was a toy like no other. Despite having no internet connection (i.e. no viruses), I lost count how many times I had to reset the computer. Possibly by deleting System32 to make more space on the 40GB Hard drive. One day, my mother surprised me with a floppy disk with some MS-DOS games, amongst it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a>. I used to enjoy editing the responses to make ELIZA say what I wanted, oblivious to its ties to Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge my parents for teaching me how to learn when I was young. They shaped a foundation which allowed me to digest all the knowledge I had an appetite for. An oil company visited my school and stated "We know more about the moon than about the depths of the oceans". I was shaping up to do engineering and now I wanted to do Petroleum Engineering. At 16 I enrolled in Aberdeen University to do exactly that. Over the next half a decade I learned in abundance. University for me was a 'primordial soup' of ideas and perspectives, which would further sculpt me as a person. My fascination with computers was rekindled, and I completed a second Masters in Artificial Intelligence when the opportunity arose.</p>

<p>Outside education I pursued other interests as I saw fit. Watching many TED talks led me to join a public speaking society. Reading one personal development book led to many more. After reading the power of now I supplemented my daily regimen with meditation. When I more than doubled my investment using cryptocurriencies back in 2014, I was hooked and have seen many ups and downs. Craving to own a business I first bought stocks and eventually incorporated my company in 2016, which dwindled due to resource constraints and other risk/reward reasons. Each adventure has taught me invaluable lessons, and I'm still looking for more..</p>
