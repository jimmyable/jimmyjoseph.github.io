<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Currently studying Artificial Intelligence at University Of Aberdeen</p>

<p>I like building and tinkering with things. I plan to mainly record stuff I learn over this year on this website. </p>

<p>At heart I am an engineer, if I can break up something(hardware/software), understand how it works or build something new from it, I'm satisfied. Lately I've been getting into learning and building software because its interesting, not expensive and not as messy.   </p>

<p>If you want to build something, or pay me to build it for you, get in touch</p>
