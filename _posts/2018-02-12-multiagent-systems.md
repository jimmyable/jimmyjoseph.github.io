# What are MultiAgent Systems?
MultiAgent systems is a field of Computer Science focusing on building autonomous agents, that can communicate with other agents. 

# Why MultiAgent Systems?
Computing is becoming more `ubiquitous`, `interconnected`, `intelligent`, more and more tasks are `delegated` to it, and it is becoming more `human-oriented`. What does this mean? Computing itself is becoming faster and more efficient. The internet created a global network interconnected devices, and now we are seeing more and more tasks delegated to these systems. A good example is a self-driving car, almost unthinkable a decade ago. 

As our requirements become more complex, we need a computing system that can manage all of this. This is the "vision" behind multiagent systems. A network of agents that can communicate effectively as humans do to get tasks done. 

In the case of self-driving cars, we ideally want cars to be communicating with each other to be most efficient. [Traffic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHzzSao6ypE) is a huge problem in our societies where we waste to much time doing nothing and still causing lots of accidents.
Traffic lights are a way for humans to communicate with each other, and they're inefficient. Computers can communicate with each other at the speed of light so it's a no-brainer.

# How to realise MultiAgent Systems?
The problem is so simple it can be summarised in just two bullet points:
- How do we `build agents` that are capable of independent, autonomous action in order to successfully carry out the tasks that we delegate to them? 
- How do we build agents that are capable of `interacting` (cooperating, coordinating, negotiating) with other agents in order to successfully carry out the tasks that we delegate to them, particularly when the other agents cannot be assumed to share the same interests/goals? 


The Textbook on this topic is [An Introduction to MultiAgent Systems](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/pubs/imas//IMAS2e.html) by Micheal Wooldridge. I have made a mindmap of the topics covered in the book below.
