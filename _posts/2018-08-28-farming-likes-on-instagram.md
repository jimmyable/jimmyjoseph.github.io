# What is farming likes?
Farming likes usually takes the form of posting "click-bait" articles or photos. Sometimes it is possible to pay to buy followers and likes/dislikes for your/someone else's posts. What's the point? `To get more likes on posts`, yeah this is society now.

Anyways, there is another way! 

# Gets Bots to do your dirty work
[InstaPy](https://timgrossmann.github.io/InstaPy/) is a bot thats designed for exactly this. **"An automation script that uses your Instagram account to like and follow others with the aim of them liking and following back".**

# So whats the gist?
You give your login credentials. Set hashtags or keywords to search and the script will do the rest. It will automatically open chrome login search and start liking/following. There is built-in delays between each action so you don't get banned for spamming, and only appropriate images with strong accounts are liked. Just make sure you don't add a massive list of keywords because liking 1000's will get you banned anyway.

Also the built-in delays mean the script will take a couple hours.
