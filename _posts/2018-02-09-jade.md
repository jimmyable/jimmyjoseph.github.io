# *J*`ava` *A*`gent` *DE*`velopment` `framework`
JADE is a framework in java that allows the realisation of agents and multi-agent systems. It complies with the [FIPA](http://www.fipa.org/) specifications. The agent platform can be distributed within a network and thus does not need to reside within one machine/OS.

## JADE Adminstration Tutorial
Introducing the notions of:
- **`Agent`**
- **`Container`**
- **`Platform`**
- **`Main Container`**
- **`AMS`** and **`DF`**

Follow the figure below. A JADE application will have `Agent` elements, each with a unique name(A1,A2,..). `Agents` act and interact by exchanging messages. 

Agents live on top of a `Platform`, which allows for services such as message delivery. A platform contains one or more `Containers`. Each container can contain 0 or more agents. A container can be thought of as a JVM.

A special container called `Main Container` always exists in the platform, it's like other containers except:
1. It's the first container to start on a platform.
2. It comes with special agents called `AMS` and `DF`, which allows starting and killing other agents and DF allows `Yellow Pages` where agents can lookup other agent's services.

## Agent Communication
All agents can communicate with each other regardless of what container they are in. All communication is in the ACL format, which includes:
- `sender` information
- `receiver` information
- the `communicative act` which represents the intention of the message, eg - INFORM, REQUEST etc. FIPA has defined the communicative acts.
- the actual `content` of the message, this will contain the information that the receiver can process or act on.
