So Let's make some stickers. I will be using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), since it's free. I will be using sticker paper to print the final A4 page onto.

# Making a hexagonal grid

I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHYTjFNSb9w) to create a hex grid in python.

Then I simply searchred for high-res transparent logos(.png) and imported them into GIMP as a Layer. Some logos required a fill to make it look better. I mainly used colours from the [Material Design](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html)

The final product looks like this:
