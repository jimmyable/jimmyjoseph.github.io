<h2 id="ch1-your-vital-20">CH1 Your vital 20%</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">80/20</code> rule. Use it to filter your life commitments.</p>

<p>Every morning when you wake up take a minute to remind what you’re thankful in life and things you’re looking forward to that day.</p>

<p>20% of bad thoughts cause 80% of the worries. Note good points throughout the day and compliment yourself on why even the most trivial ones(since you worry about trivial negatives).</p>

<p>Compliment others on their positive work.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, look over the events of the day highlighting good and bad. Make sure to reflect and write down how you would do differently next time.</p>

<p>80% of your desk is cluttered with items you use less than 20% of the time.</p>

<p>Before breaking out of a long commitment/investment. Ask yourself if you were to start again now with 0 commitment to this issue would you do it. You can even imagine you’re advising your friend and then take that advice.</p>

<h2 id="ch2-focus-on-your-life-goals">CH2 Focus on your life goals</h2>

<h3 id="write-down-smart-goals">Write down <code class="highlighter-rouge">SMART</code> goals.</h3>

<blockquote>

    <p><strong>M</strong> - measurable</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><em>They say a goal without a deadline is just a wish.</em></p>

<p>Make sure your goal is as specific as possible. Break it down. Celebrate your milestones as well.</p>

<p>There is only one true deadline, when you finish the task. Keep trying until then and refine your process until you get there.</p>

<p>Planning is good but doing is better. Consider cutting down on planning and putting more attention on achieving. In business there are two stages, planning the work and working the plan</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The only way you can fail is if you stop”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can’t focus on what you don’t see. Use the proverb <em>‘out of sight,out of mind’</em>.</p>

<p>You have made the goals. Realise you are the hero, and this is your movie. Work through the goals and use goal maps to help you define your path. Reap the rewards.</p>

<h1 id="part-2---your-focus-strategies"><em>Part 2 - Your focus strategies</em></h1>

<h2 id="ch3-how-to-focus-your-time-patterns-for-success">CH3 How to focus your time patterns for success</h2>

<p>Everyone has patterns and doing the same things give the same results.</p>

<p>Your patterns:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Get in shape déjà vu. (Go to the gym for a week then quit)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Continuous financial discontent</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doing the least important work first</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Procrastination</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fire fighting</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Letting the inner critic dominate thoughts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can ask other people to give your faults do you can work on them(your family and gf already do this).</p>

<p>Imagine your situation but with made up people. Using dissociation you can analyse the real situation without having emotional input.</p>

<p>You can teach your problem to an imaginary person. Give us much as detail on how you keep repeating your patterns.</p>

<p>You can also map your patterns to see how you keep falling off your trajectory and into the same old patterns.</p>

<p>You suffer from paralysis by analysis. Because deep down you know as long as you keep planning and not act, you can’t fail.</p>

<p>Don’t be shy to say no. Everything making you say yes is your own imagination. You imagine they will be upset. Or you imagine it’s a great project with no pitfalls. The reality is you overcommitting will actually make them upset because you won’t be able to give the project the full attention it deserves. Your other projects will suffer because it’s not a straight road.</p>

<h2 id="ch4---how-to-overcome-the-obstacles-to-focus">CH4 - How to overcome the obstacles to focus</h2>

<p>Get rid of the useless 80%. Like filing or filling in forms etc.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Eliminate or reduce work

Delegate the work 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much of the time doing what we should be doing is a lot less enjoyable than doing something else.</p>

<p>You resonate with this quote, on reasons why you fail. “You know, it was because when I had to choose between doing the easy things and the difficult things, I generally took the easy path”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He has the deed half done so has made a beginning”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For gym.  Just commit to stepping out of the door with your gym bag. Drove to the gym and park. Not even go in.</p>

<p>CREATING A FLOW</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Pick a task that is at or just above your level of ability 

Make sure the task involves immediate feedback 

Create an atmosphere in which you have as few distractions as possible 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add small chunks of time here and there. For example add 20 mins of goal work with shopping. Do go to a coffee and do that too.</p>

<p>Reward yourself, when you overcome obstacles. OBSTACLES.</p>

<h2 id="ch5-how-to-focus-on-what-already-works">CH5 How to focus on what already works</h2>

<p>The mistaken strategy is to focus on your weaknesses instead of your strengths.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everyone should carefully observe which way his heart draws him, and then choose that way with all his strength”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to join the top 5% of achieved in any field, you will have to do more of what you do well, and worry less about becoming good at what you don’t do well. It’s perfectly logical isn’t it?</p>

<p>If there’s something you don’t do well at all, and you put effort into getting better at it, the odds are that with a lot of work you’ll just become mediocre.</p>

<p>NOTICE WHEN THINGS ARE GOING RIGHT</p>

<p>A good way to remember to do a review of your day and what you can learn from what went right is to link it to something you do everynight. Like brushing your teeth.</p>

<p>You get your best ideas in the shower. In bed right before falling asleep? during the ad-breaks when watching TV?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is vital that you capture any great ideas before you’re distracted”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try writing down your dreams. Dreams are metaphors, so the solution to your problem may appear as some kind of symbol. Let your mind flow free to come up with ideas of what the dream may be trying to tell you.</p>

<p>When you do what you know is right thing to do, you have immense power. However, most people find that power is sapped by procrastination.</p>

<h2 id="ch6-how-to-finally-best-procrastination">CH6 How to (finally) best procrastination</h2>

<p>Shakespeare:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Better three hours too soon than one minute too late”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“I wasted time, and now doth time waste me”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The temptations of procrastination.</p>

<p>An object at rest tends to stay at rest and and object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>

<p>So, in order to change direction, we have to make some effort.</p>

<p>Here’s the key fact: generally, the ‘good” option pays off in the long run. The “bad” option pays off immediately. Therefore, the “bad” option is stronger in the moment.</p>

<p>Here is the other crucial difference: the short term option often strongly engages our senses and emotions, Whereas the long term option because it is not present right now only engages our intellect.</p>

<p>To overcome procrastination:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Close your eyes and visualise the OUTCOME of the "good" choice. 

What will you SEE once you do this? Maybe good comments on the internet 

What will you HEAR? Like compliments? 

What will you FEEL? Happy? Proud? Joyful? 

Maybe TASTE? Champagne? 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you’ve visualised whatever is most motivating for you, stay in the state of excitement after you open your eyes - suddenly, watching TV or surfing the internet will seem pretty boring by comparison. Launch into the task while the feeling is still fresh.</p>

<p>You can add more focus with the power of an anchor.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Choose a state of positive energy and feelings. Use the image of finishing the work and enjoying the fruits 

Stand up, close your eyes and use your imagination to be in the end point as possible 

Keep "turning up the volume" of these feelings until they feel really strong 

When you achieve the peak, make a gesture like squeezing together your thumb and forefinger. 

Hold it for s second and then release. This becomes your anchor and you can signal to experience this state. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your reasons for resistance and how to overcome them</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Because the conditions aren't right 

Because I don't want to and you can't make me! 

Work on toning down your harsh inner critic 

Because it doesn't feel good 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Taking the first step</p>

<p>The first step is often the hardest</p>

<p>If you’re state oriented, Pychyl suggests acknowledging that you don’t feel like doing the task, but promise yourself you’ll do it for 10 minutes. By the time you get to end of the period, most likely your state will have shifted and you’ll be able to continue.</p>

<p>THE GAMBLER - make your to do list and then shuffle them and just get it done. Max list of tasks is 6!</p>

<h2 id="ch7-how-to-use-the-alter-ego-strategy">CH7 How to use the alter Ego strategy</h2>

<p>You have many different personsilties</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“we act differently in different situations”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do have a choice</p>

<p>Alter egos- by putting the right one in charge. You can do your task more effectively, efficient and usually with more enjoyment.</p>

<p>First, if to tend to respond and substitute another one. One example of this is “Counting to 10”.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Pretend for a moment that you were going to hire someone to do the job for you. What kind of attributes and attitudes would you look for? 

Hire yourself as a consultant. You're a high priced consultant who is going to assess how to maximize the returns in your life. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn’t”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Periodically call in the consultant to evaluate how things are going. Maybe meet with the consultant on the first day of each month?</p>

<h2 id="ch8-how-to-manage-other-people">CH8 How to manage other people</h2>

<p>We all need support</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We train other people how to treat us”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are people negative?</p>

<p>…pointed out that basically the world can be split into <strong>positive people- those who expect to win, and negative people - those who expect to be right.</strong></p>

<p>This is a terrific insight: the people who are negative about anything new or unusual often are not actually interested in the thing being undertaken, they are determined to be right. And, because list new things gaul, the best way to be right us to be negative.</p>

<p>Do you know what’s people want?</p>

<p>Recognition! We all want to be appreciated, to be seen seen special. Even when we are small, “mum, look at me” and “dad, see what I can do”</p>

<p>How to give recognition</p>

<p>It’s ironic that the things people want the most costs us nothing to give, get most of us are extremely sparing with it.</p>

<p><em>-Learn to really listen</em></p>

<p><em>-Increase your eye contact</em></p>

<p><em>-Use their name</em></p>

<p><em>-Give genuine compliments</em></p>

<p><em>-Notice and comment on it when someone does something you wanted them to do</em></p>

<p><em>-Ask for advice</em></p>

<p><em>-Say thanks</em></p>

<p><em>-Use pen and paper to write them cards/letters/messages</em></p>

<h2 id="ch9-how-to-focus-your-language-for-extraordinary-results">CH9 How to focus your language for extraordinary results</h2>

  <p>“we are all working from different scripts - no wonder communication can be difficult”</p>

<p>NLP/ Establish greater rapport by matching their language</p>

<p>Using NLP. You can match their language using visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic categories.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Visual person - "That's clear", or "I see your point", or "Give me some time to look at that"

Kinaesthetic person - "I have s rough idea", or "Those are pretty heavy numbers" or "My gut instinct is that you're right" 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have trouble pacing someone’s mood, try matching their posture and how they hold their heads (subtly). Then very gradually change your posture to more closely match the mood you’d like to encourage in the other person. If you do it well they will also change posture.</p>

<p>Persuade through the power of reframing</p>

<p>Defuse the opposition with Three questions technique</p>

<p>You may be surprised at how often what the other person says first isn’t really what they mean. Asking at least three questions will help you get to the bottom of their meaning, and then you can respond to that</p>

<p>You say yes so they say no(how to cope with polarity responses)</p>
