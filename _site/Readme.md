# How to make me work!
First clone the repo(duh!)

Then install **Ruby**:
- `sudo apt install ruby-dev`

Then install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/):
- `sudo gem install bundler jekyll`

Wooo! You've just installed Jekyll!!

## Now we gotta install gulp and npm(Don't ask me why)
Use `sudo apt install gulp npm`

### While in the repo
Now you can use `npm install` and it does a bunch of stuff, like installing npm modules.

If you use `gulp`, it will compile and show you what you are editing in real time

When you're done, do `jekyll serve`, and all you have to do is `git push`, the website is now updated.
